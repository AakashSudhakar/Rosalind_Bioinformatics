NAME:               Finding a Shared Motif (Bioinformatics Stronghold)
CONTRIBUTOR:        Aakash Sudhakar

PROBLEM:            A common substring of a collection of strings is a substring of 
                    every member of the collection. We say that a common substring is 
                    a longest common substring if there does not exist a longer 
                    common substring. For example, "CG" is a common substring of "ACGTACGT" 
                    and "AACCGTATA", but it is not as long as possible; in this case, 
                    "CGTA" is a longest common substring of "ACGTACGT" and "AACCGTATA".

                    Note that the longest common substring is not necessarily unique; 
                    for a simple example, "AA" and "CC" are both longest common substrings 
                    of "AACC" and "CCAA".

DATASET:            A collection of k (kâ‰¤100) DNA strings of length at most 1 kbp each 
                    in FASTA format.

OUTPUT:             A longest common substring of the collection. 
                    (If multiple solutions exist, you may return any single solution.)

SAMPLE DATASET:     >Rosalind_1
                    GATTACA
                    >Rosalind_2
                    TAGACCA
                    >Rosalind_3
                    ATACA

SAMPLE OUTPUT:      AC

STATUS:             Submission failed: INCORRECT.
